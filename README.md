# Road-lane-detection
The project focuses on developing a system that can detect and visualize road lanes from images or video streams. The primary objective is to assist autonomous vehicles and enhance driver assistance systems by providing accurate lane information.

## Project Structure
Dataset: The dataset directory contains the datasets used for training and testing the road lane detection model. Ensure proper permissions for data usage.
Code: The code directory includes all source code for the road lane detection project. Key files: train.py: Train the lane detection model on the provided dataset. inference.py: Use this script to apply the trained model to new images or video streams.
Models: The models directory stores the trained lane detection models. After training, model files will be saved here.
Documentation: The docs directory contains project documentation, including this README file.
