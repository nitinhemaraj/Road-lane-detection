# Road-lane-detection
The project focuses on developing a system that can detect and visualize road lanes from images or video streams. The primary objective is to assist autonomous vehicles and enhance driver assistance systems by providing accurate lane information.

## Why Road Lane Detection Matters?
Road lane detection is a fundamental task in autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). By accurately identifying and visualizing road lanes, vehicles can make informed decisions about their position within a lane, enabling safe lane-keeping, lane-change assistance, and even full autonomous driving. This technology has the potential to significantly reduce traffic accidents, improve traffic flow, and enhance the overall driving experience.

## Getting Started
To get started with our Road Lane Detection system, please refer to the documentation and installation instructions provided in the repository's Wiki section. You can also find sample images and videos to test the system's capabilities.

## Features

### Lane Detection
Our system employs advanced computer vision techniques to accurately detect and highlight road lanes in images or video frames. This feature is crucial for applications like autonomous driving and lane-keeping assistance.

### Real-time Processing
We offer real-time lane detection capabilities, allowing our system to process video streams from cameras mounted on vehicles or any other camera-equipped device.

### Visualization
The project includes visualization tools to display detected lane boundaries, making it easier for users to understand the lane information and its applicability in various scenarios.

### Robustness
The system is designed to work under a variety of lighting and weather conditions, making it suitable for deployment in real-world environments.

### Easy Integration
We provide comprehensive documentation and easy-to-follow instructions for integrating the lane detection system into your own projects, making it a valuable resource for developers and researchers in the field of autonomous vehicles and computer vision.
